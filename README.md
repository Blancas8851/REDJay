# REDJay

## Project Description

In this project the team decided to create a donation site that would show all current available items available in the donations store. The Goal of our project was to not only show what is available and give them a location of where to go but to also allow the users to donate their items through the website in which an admin (or higher up employee) will be able to approve this upload. Once approved by the admin the product will then be put directly on our website's “selling” page and be displayed for the world to see.
